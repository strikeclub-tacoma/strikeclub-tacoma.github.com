### Details:
- Date: {{ page.event_date }}
- Time: 4:00 PM
- Meeting Place: In front of the [Pantages Theature](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pantages+Theater/@47.2551015,-122.440179,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xbbddd330736aebb) in downtown Tacoma 

### Additional Information: (what to bring, etc.)

Bring a change of clothes, ideally something that can be thrown away.  To jazz up the experience, you might consider bringing that old suit you never wear anymore.  Or, you might go for that Ray Allen jersey that's just collecting dust.  Anyway, feel free to "explore the space" with your clothing, but know that whatever you bring might get trashed.

The night should wrap up around 10:30PM with an optional extension for those not quite ready to call it quits.

Dinner will be provided, but for those of us with healthier appetites, you might want to eat something before you arrive.

I need $100 from Chuck and David (and our bench player).  Any chance I could get the money this week?
