Strike Club,

A few details to get you ready for Saturday.  We will meet at Chalet Bowl in
the Proctor District between 4:30pm and 5:30pm.  My kids soccer game is now
ending earlier so the start time is flexible but we have the lanes at 4:30pm
so come early if you can.

The Strike Club Theme will be "Climate Change"

We will be walking to all venues (not burning fossil fuels) so wear
comfortable walking shoes.  The night will end in downtown Tacoma after
midnight so plan on taking Uber or a cab home ideally.  Jake has offered for
people to sleep in his chicken coup if necessary.
