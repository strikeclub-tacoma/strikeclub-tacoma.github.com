### Additional Information: (what to bring, etc.)


Strike Club,

A few details to get you ready for Saturday.  We will meet at Chalet Bowl in the Proctor District between 4:30pm and 5:30pm.  My kids soccer game is now ending earlier so the start time is flexible but we have the lanes at 4:30pm so come early if you can.

The Strike Club Theme will be **"Climate Change"**

We will be walking to all venues (not burning fossil fuels) so wear comfortable walking shoes.  The night will end in downtown Tacoma after midnight so plan on taking Uber or a cab home ideally.  Jake has offered for people to sleep in his chicken coup if necessary.
